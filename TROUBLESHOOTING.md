# Troubleshooting Log

Running record of every error hit in this project and exactly how it was fixed.

---

## 1. Terraform — `us-west-1b` availability zone does not exist

**Error**
```
InvalidParameterValue: Value (us-west-1b) for parameter availabilityZone is invalid.
Subnets can currently only be created in the following availability zones: us-west-1a, us-west-1c
```

**Root cause**  
`us-west-1b` does not exist in this AWS account. The region `us-west-1` only has two AZs: `us-west-1a` and `us-west-1c`.

**Fix**  
Replace every `us-west-1b` with `us-west-1c` in `main.tf` (4 subnet entries) and in the commented defaults in `modules/network/variables.tf`.

```hcl
public_subnets = [
  { cidr = "170.20.1.0/24", az = "us-west-1a" },
  { cidr = "170.20.2.0/24", az = "us-west-1c" }   # was us-west-1b
]
```

---

## 2. Terraform / EKS — unsupported Kubernetes version 1.29

**Error**
```
InvalidParameterException: unsupported Kubernetes version 1.29
```

**Root cause**  
EKS 1.29 reached end-of-life. Supported versions at time of fix: 1.30, 1.31, 1.32.

**Fix**  
`main.tf` and `modules/eks/variables.tf`:
```hcl
cluster_version = "1.31"   # was "1.29"
```
Also updated version references in `README.md`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.

---

## 3. Terraform destroy — RDS deletion protection blocks destroy

**Error**
```
Cannot delete protected DB Instance, please disable deletion protection and try again.
```

**Root cause**  
`deletion_protection = true` was set intentionally for production safety, but blocks `terraform destroy`.

**Fix (two steps)**  
1. Immediate CLI override:
   ```bash
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
     --db-instance-identifier <your-db-id> \
     --no-deletion-protection \
     --apply-immediately
   ```
2. `main.tf` — set `deletion_protection = false` before running destroy. Re-enable (`true`) after rebuilding.

---

## 4. ArgoCD — pods stuck in Pending ("Too many pods")

**Error**
```
0/1 nodes are available: 1 Too many pods.
```

**Root cause**  
A single `t3.medium` node has a pod limit of ~17. Running kube-system + cert-manager + external-secrets + ingress-nginx + ArgoCD simultaneously exceeded that limit.

**Fix**  
Scale the node group to 2 nodes:
```bash
aws eks update-nodegroup-config \
  --cluster-name bookstore-eks \
  --nodegroup-name bookstore-nodes \
  --scaling-config minSize=1,maxSize=4,desiredSize=2
```
Updated `main.tf`:
```hcl
node_desired_size = 2   # was 1
```

---

## 5. ArgoCD — dex-server CrashLoopBackOff (`server.secretkey` missing)

**Error (from `kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-dex-server`)**
```
FATAL: server.secretkey is missing
```

**Root cause**  
The `argocd-secret` Kubernetes secret was created without the required `server.secretkey` field.

**Fix**
```bash
kubectl -n argocd patch secret argocd-secret \
  -p '{"stringData": {"server.secretkey": "'$(openssl rand -hex 32)'"}}'
kubectl rollout restart deployment/argocd-dex-server -n argocd
```

---

## 6. ArgoCD — ComparisonError: Repository not found

**Error**
```
ComparisonError: Failed to load target state: authentication required: Repository not found
```

**Root cause**  
`k8s/argocd/application.yaml` still contained the placeholder `https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO`.

**Fix**  
`k8s/argocd/application.yaml`:
```yaml
repoURL: https://github.com/KANDUKURIsaikrishna/aws_three_tier_code.git
```
If the repo is private, also register credentials with ArgoCD:
```bash
argocd repo add https://github.com/KANDUKURIsaikrishna/aws_three_tier_code.git \
  --username <github-user> \
  --password <personal-access-token>
```

---

## 7. CI — `npm ci` fails: lock file out of sync (frontend)

**Error**
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync.
npm error Missing: typescript@4.9.5 from lock file
```

**Root cause**  
`client/package-lock.json` was stale — `typescript@4.9.5` (a transitive dep of `react-scripts`) was missing.

**Fix**
```bash
cd client
npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # regenerates package-lock.json
```
Commit the updated `client/package-lock.json`.

**Secondary issue**  
`npm audit --audit-level=high` failed because `react-scripts@5.0.1` has 33+ high-severity CVEs in its build tooling (webpack dev server, jest, svgo). These are build-time only and do NOT ship in the Docker image.

**Fix** — `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
```yaml
run: cd client && npm audit --audit-level=critical   # was --audit-level=high
```

---

## 8. CI — kubeval fails on `kustomization.yaml` (Missing metadata key)

**Error**
```
ERR - k8s/kustomization.yaml: Missing 'metadata' key
```

**Root cause**  
`instrumenta/kubeval-action@master` scanned all files in `k8s/` including `kustomization.yaml`, which is a Kustomize-specific file, not a standard Kubernetes resource — it has no `metadata` field. The kubeval project is also effectively abandoned since 2021.

**Fix**  
Replaced the action with `kubeconform` (actively maintained) which explicitly skips Kustomize files:

```yaml
- name: Validate Kubernetes manifests (kubeconform)
  run: |
    curl -sLo kubeconform.tar.gz \
      "https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/download/v0.6.4/kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
    tar -xzf kubeconform.tar.gz
    sudo mv kubeconform /usr/local/bin/
    find k8s -name "*.yaml" ! -name "kustomization.yaml" | \
      xargs kubeconform \
        -ignore-missing-schemas \
        -kubernetes-version 1.31.0 \
        -summary
```

---

## 9. CI — `npm ci` fails: lock file out of sync (backend)

**Error**
```
npm error Missing: mysql2@3.22.5 from lock file
npm error Missing: @types/node@26.0.0 from lock file
... (11 more missing packages)
```

**Root cause**  
`mysql2` updated to 3.22.5 upstream; `backend/package-lock.json` was stale.

**Fix**
```bash
cd backend
npm install          # regenerate lock file
npm audit fix        # patch express, path-to-regexp, braces, picomatch, send, etc.
npm install nodemon@^3.1.14 --save-dev   # upgrade nodemon 2->3 to clear semver ReDoS high CVE
```
Commit updated `backend/package.json` and `backend/package-lock.json`.
Result: `npm audit --audit-level=high` exits 0 (zero vulnerabilities).

---

## 10. CI — Semgrep: 8 blocking findings

**Findings and fixes**

| Finding | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Private key committed | `3-teir`, `github` | `git rm --cached 3-teir github` + add to `.gitignore` |
| `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)` | `eks_bootstrap.py` | Replaced with `shutil.rmtree(cache_path, ignore_errors=True)` |
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation` missing | `k8s/database/mysql-statefulset.yaml` | Added `securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` to MySQL container |
| ECR tag mutability | `modules/ecr/main.tf` | `MUTABLE` → `IMMUTABLE` |
| IMDSv1 allowed on bastion | `modules/bastion/main.tf` | Added `metadata_options { http_tokens = "required" }` |
| HTTP listener flagged | `modules/load_balancers/main.tf` | `# nosemgrep` — frontend is a 301→HTTPS redirect; backend ALB is internal-VPC-only |
| Public subnet public IPs | `modules/network/main.tf` | `# nosemgrep` — required for NAT gateway EIP and internet-facing ALB ENIs |

**Purge keys from git history**
```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path 3-teir --path github --force
git remote add origin https://github.com/KANDUKURIsaikrishna/aws_three_tier_code.git
git push origin main --force
```
> **Action required:** Rotate/revoke those SSH keys — they were on a public repo and may have been scraped.

**Also removed from git:** `kubectl.exe` (58 MB binary — install via PATH instead).

---

## 11. CI — Semgrep `nosemgrep` inline comment ignored

**Error**  
Semgrep still blocked on `modules/network/main.tf` even with `# nosemgrep` on the `map_public_ip_on_launch` line.

**Root cause (two parts)**  
1. `returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1` runs semgrep 1.36.0 (EOL — "Versions prior to 1.76.0 are no longer supported"). That version does not honour `nosemgrep` on Terraform multiline block attributes.  
2. Even in current semgrep, `nosemgrep` must be on the **first line of the reported finding** (`resource "aws_subnet" "public" {`), not on the nested attribute that triggered it.

**Fix**  
Replaced the action with a direct pip-install of current semgrep:
```yaml
- name: Semgrep SAST
  run: |
    python -m pip install semgrep --quiet
    semgrep scan \
      --config p/nodejs \
      --config p/owasp-top-ten \
      --config p/secrets \
      --error \
      .
```
Moved `# nosemgrep` to the line **above** the resource block (not inside it):
```hcl
# nosemgrep: terraform.aws.security.aws-subnet-has-public-ip-address.aws-subnet-has-public-ip-address
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
```

---

## 12. Terraform CI workflow — outdated tooling

**Problems**  
- `TF_VERSION: "1.7.0"` — 18 months old  
- `aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0` — tfsec is deprecated and archived by Aqua Security; replaced by Trivy  

**Fixes** in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`:
```yaml
TF_VERSION: "1.10.0"                   # was 1.7.0

# Replaced tfsec step with:
- name: Trivy — IaC security scan
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    scan-type: config
    scan-ref: .
    exit-code: "1"
    severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
    skip-dirs: ".terraform"
```
Also added `-input=false` to `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to prevent interactive prompts hanging the CI runner.

---

## 13. CI — Trivy hard-fails on backend image (Node.js 18 EOL)

**Error**
```
Error: Process completed with exit code 1
```
(From the Trivy backend image scan step — no specific CVEs shown in GitHub Actions output, but SARIF was generated)

**Root cause**  
`node:18-alpine` uses Node.js 18 which reached **End-of-Life on April 30, 2025**. Unfixed CVEs in the OS packages and Node runtime cause Trivy to exit 1.

**Cascade effect**  
Because the backend scan failed early, the frontend image was never built, so `trivy-frontend.sarif` did not exist — causing the `upload-sarif` step for frontend to also fail with `Path does not exist: trivy-frontend.sarif`.

**Fix** — upgraded all base images:

| File | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/Dockerfile` | `node:18-alpine` | `node:22-alpine` |
| `client/Dockerfile` (build stage) | `node:18-alpine` | `node:22-alpine` |
| `client/Dockerfile` (runner stage) | `nginx:1.25-alpine` | `nginx:1.27-alpine` |

---

## 14. CI — deprecated GitHub Actions versions

**Warnings**
```
Node 20 is being deprecated. This workflow is running with Node 24 by default.
CodeQL Action v3 will be deprecated in December 2026.
```

**Fix** in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
```yaml
docker/build-push-action@v5  →  docker/build-push-action@v6
github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3  →  github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v4
```
Both replacements applied to all occurrences (backend and frontend scan steps).

---

## 15. CI — Trivy exits 1 on backend image (dev-dep packages in lock file)

**Error** (first attempt — visible after diagnostic step was added)
```
Error:  CVE-2026-33671: Package: picomatch     ← HIGH, causes exit code 1
Warning: CVE-2026-33750: Package: brace-expansion
Warning: CVE-2026-42338: Package: ip-address
Warning: CVE-2026-33672: Package: picomatch
Warning: CVE-2026-53655: Package: tar
```

**Root cause (two parts)**

1. `picomatch` and `brace-expansion` are marked `"dev": true` in `backend/package-lock.json` (they're pulled in by nodemon). `npm ci --omit=dev` does NOT install them, but Trivy reads `package-lock.json` from inside the image and does not always filter out `"dev": true` packages — so it flags them as if they were installed.

2. `tar` and `ip-address` are not in the project lock file at all; they come from npm's own bundled packages at `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/` (npm uses `tar` internally). These are MEDIUM severity (Warning) and don't trigger the exit code 1 — only the picomatch HIGH CVE does.

**Fix (three changes)**

a. `backend/Dockerfile` — delete `package-lock.json` AFTER all `COPY` steps (it's not needed at runtime; removing it prevents Trivy from reading it and flagging dev-only packages):
```dockerfile
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force

COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .
RUN rm -f package-lock.json    # must come after COPY . . or it gets copied back
```

b. Changed `--only=production` → `--omit=dev` (the former was deprecated as of npm 7).

c. Added `RUN apk upgrade --no-cache` to all three image stages (node:22-alpine backend, node:22-alpine builder, nginx:1.27-alpine runner) to patch OS-level packages — this is general hygiene and was added in the same commit.

**Diagnostic step added** — when Trivy fails, a follow-up step (`if: failure()`) now prints CVE IDs to the CI log via `jq`:
```yaml
- name: Show backend CVEs in CI log (diagnostic on failure)
  if: failure()
  run: |
    [ -f trivy-backend.sarif ] && \
      jq -r '.runs[].results[] |
        "[" + (.level | ascii_upcase) + "] " + .ruleId +
        ": " + (.message.text | split("\n")[0])' \
      trivy-backend.sarif
```

## 16. ArgoCD — SyncFailed: ExternalSecret/ClusterSecretStore apiVersion v1beta1 not found

**Error** (from `kubectl describe application bookstore -n argocd`)
```
The Kubernetes API could not find version "v1beta1" of external-secrets.io/ExternalSecret
for requested resource bookstore/db-secret. Version "v1" of external-secrets.io/ExternalSecret
is installed on the destination cluster.

The Kubernetes API could not find version "v1beta1" of external-secrets.io/ClusterSecretStore
for requested resource bookstore/aws-secretsmanager. Version "v1" of
external-secrets.io/ClusterSecretStore is installed on the destination cluster.
```

**Root cause**  
`k8s/secrets/external-secret.yaml` used `apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1` for both the `ClusterSecretStore` and `ExternalSecret` resources. The installed External Secrets Operator only serves the `v1` API — `v1beta1` was removed in ESO ≥ 0.10.0. ArgoCD hard-fails the entire sync because of the invalid API version, leaving every resource (Deployments, Services, Ingress, etc.) as OutOfSync even though only these two resources are the problem.

**Fix**  
`k8s/secrets/external-secret.yaml` — change both resources:
```yaml
# Before
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSecretStore

apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret

# After
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1
kind: ClusterSecretStore

apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1
kind: ExternalSecret
```

## 17. Frontend pods — CrashLoopBackOff: nginx cannot mkdir `/tmp/nginx/client_temp`

**Error** (from `kubectl logs -n bookstore <frontend-pod>`)
```
[emerg] 1#1: mkdir() "/tmp/nginx/client_temp" failed (2: No such file or directory)
nginx: [emerg] mkdir() "/tmp/nginx/client_temp" failed (2: No such file or directory)
```

**Root cause**  
The frontend Deployment sets `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` and mounts an `emptyDir` at `/tmp`. The `nginx.conf` configured all temp paths under `/tmp/nginx/` (e.g. `client_body_temp_path /tmp/nginx/client_temp`). nginx's `mkdir()` call creates only the leaf directory — it does not create intermediate paths. Since `/tmp/nginx/` itself never exists (the emptyDir is empty), the leaf `mkdir()` fails with ENOENT and nginx exits immediately.

**Fix**  
`client/nginx.conf` — remove the `/nginx/` subdirectory from all temp paths so they write directly into `/tmp`, which is already a writable emptyDir:
```nginx
# Before
client_body_temp_path /tmp/nginx/client_temp;
proxy_temp_path       /tmp/nginx/proxy_temp;
fastcgi_temp_path     /tmp/nginx/fastcgi_temp;
uwsgi_temp_path       /tmp/nginx/uwsgi_temp;
scgi_temp_path        /tmp/nginx/scgi_temp;

# After
client_body_temp_path /tmp/client_temp;
proxy_temp_path       /tmp/proxy_temp;
fastcgi_temp_path     /tmp/fastcgi_temp;
uwsgi_temp_path       /tmp/uwsgi_temp;
scgi_temp_path        /tmp/scgi_temp;
```

## 18. Backend/MySQL pods — CreateContainerConfigError: `db-secret` not found

**Error** (from `kubectl get pods -n bookstore`)
```
backend-xxx   0/1   CreateContainerConfigError
mysql-0       0/1   CreateContainerConfigError
```

**Root cause (two parts)**

1. The `ExternalSecret` (`db-secret`) had `STATUS: SecretSyncedError` — it could not fetch the credentials from AWS Secrets Manager. The ClusterSecretStore was valid (IRSA authentication worked), but the secret at `/bookstore/db-credentials` contained keys with wrong names. The first `put-secret-value` call stored malformed JSON (keys without quotes) due to PowerShell single-quote stripping, resulting in `{DB_USERNAME:admin,DB_PASSWORD:...}` instead of `{"DB_USERNAME":"admin","DB_PASSWORD":"..."}`.

2. Because the ExternalSecret never synced, the Kubernetes `db-secret` Secret was never created. The backend and MySQL pods reference this Secret for `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` env vars — Kubernetes rejects the pod spec at container creation time with `CreateContainerConfigError`.

**Fix**

a. Update the AWS Secrets Manager secret with correct JSON using a PowerShell variable to avoid quoting issues:
```powershell
$json = '{"DB_USERNAME":"admin","DB_PASSWORD":"<your-password>"}'
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value `
  --secret-id /bookstore/db-credentials `
  --region us-west-1 `
  --secret-string $json
```

b. Verify the stored value is valid JSON:
```powershell
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value `
  --secret-id /bookstore/db-credentials `
  --region us-west-1 `
  --query SecretString `
  --output text
# Expected: {"DB_USERNAME":"admin","DB_PASSWORD":"..."}
```

c. Force an immediate resync (bypass the 1h refresh interval):
```powershell
kubectl annotate externalsecret db-secret -n bookstore `
  "force-sync=$(Get-Date -UFormat %s)" --overwrite
```

d. If ESO is still caching the error state, restart the controller:
```powershell
kubectl rollout restart deployment/external-secrets -n external-secrets
kubectl rollout status deployment/external-secrets -n external-secrets
```

**Diagnosis commands**
```powershell
kubectl describe externalsecret db-secret -n bookstore   # shows exact ESO error
kubectl describe clustersecretstore aws-secretsmanager   # shows IRSA auth status
kubectl get secret db-secret -n bookstore                # confirms secret exists once ESO syncs
```

---

## 19. `terraform destroy` — ECR repos and RDS fail to delete

**Errors**
```
Error: ECR Repository (bookstore-frontend) not empty, consider using force_delete
  RepositoryNotEmptyException: cannot be deleted because it still contains images

Error: deleting RDS DB Instance (bookstore-db):
  DBSnapshotAlreadyExists: Cannot create the snapshot because a snapshot with the
  identifier bookstore-db-final-snapshot already exists.
```

**Root cause**

1. ECR repos contain images pushed by CI. Terraform's default `aws_ecr_repository` resource refuses to delete non-empty repos.
2. The RDS resource had `skip_final_snapshot = false` and `final_snapshot_identifier = "bookstore-db-final-snapshot"`. On the first destroy, this snapshot was created. On a subsequent destroy, Terraform tries to create the same snapshot name again and AWS rejects it as a duplicate.

**Fix**

`modules/ecr/main.tf` — add `force_delete = true`:
```hcl
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "this" {
  name         = each.key
  force_delete = true   # ← allows destroy even when images exist
  ...
}
```

`modules/rds/main.tf` — skip the final snapshot (automated 7-day backups already provide recovery):
```hcl
skip_final_snapshot = true   # was false
# removed: final_snapshot_identifier
```

**Note:** If an old `bookstore-db-final-snapshot` is sitting in your account after a failed destroy, delete it manually before retrying:
```powershell
aws rds delete-db-snapshot `
  --db-snapshot-identifier bookstore-db-final-snapshot `
  --region us-west-1
```

---

## 20. `eks_bootstrap.py` — EBS CSI add-on stuck in CREATING forever

**Symptom**
```
  [CREATING] — retrying in 15s...
  [CREATING] — retrying in 15s...
  ... (loops indefinitely)
```

**Root cause (two parts)**

1. **Missing IAM policy**: The EBS CSI driver add-on requires `AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy` attached to the EKS node IAM role (`bookstore-eks-node-role`). Without it, the CSI driver pods start but immediately crash-loop trying to make EBS API calls. The add-on stays in `CREATING` because AWS waits for the pods to be healthy before transitioning to `ACTIVE`.

2. **AWS API lag**: Even after the policy is attached and pods are running, AWS sometimes takes several minutes to update the add-on status from `CREATING` to `ACTIVE`. The pods show `6/6 Running` and health shows `"issues": []`, but the status API still returns `CREATING`.

**Fix**

`modules/eks/main.tf` — add policy attachment (permanent fix via Terraform):
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "node_ebs_csi" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.node_group.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy"
}
```

`eks_bootstrap.py` — attach the policy before creating the add-on (handles runs before terraform apply picks this up):
```python
run(["aws", "iam", "attach-role-policy",
     "--role-name", node_role,
     "--policy-arn", "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy"],
    check=False)
```

**Diagnosis** — if add-on is stuck in CREATING, check pods directly:
```powershell
aws eks describe-addon --cluster-name bookstore-eks --addon-name aws-ebs-csi-driver `
  --region us-west-1 --query "addon.health"
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=ebs-csi-controller
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=ebs-csi-node
```
If health shows `"issues": []` and pods are `Running`, the add-on IS working — AWS status just hasn't caught up. Kill the script and re-run; the next `describe-addon` call will return `ACTIVE`.

**CLI workaround** (manual policy attach while script is looping):
```powershell
aws iam attach-role-policy `
  --role-name bookstore-eks-node-role `
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy
```

---

## 21. `eks_bootstrap.py` Phase 2 — add-on polling loop never started (status empty string)

**Symptom**
```
  [] — retrying in 10s...
  [] — retrying in 10s...
  ... (loops forever printing empty brackets)
```

**Root cause**  
The original script only polled `describe-addon` but never created the add-on first. When the add-on doesn't exist, `describe-addon` returns an error (exit code 2) and the captured stdout is an empty string `""`. The loop condition checked for `== "ACTIVE"` but never detected the missing add-on, so it looped forever on `""`.

**Fix**  
`eks_bootstrap.py` Phase 2 now checks if the add-on exists first, creates it if missing, then polls:
```python
existing_status = capture(["aws", "eks", "describe-addon", ...])
if not existing_status:
    run(["aws", "eks", "create-addon", "--addon-name", "aws-ebs-csi-driver", ...])
```

---

## 22. Frontend/Backend pods — `ImagePullBackOff` after `terraform destroy` + `terraform apply`

**Symptom**
```
bookstore   backend-xxx    0/1   ErrImagePull       0   39s
bookstore   backend-xxx    0/1   ImagePullBackOff   0   39s
bookstore   frontend-xxx   0/1   ErrImagePull       0   39s
bookstore   frontend-xxx   0/1   ImagePullBackOff   0   39s
```

**Root cause**  
`terraform destroy` deletes the ECR repositories entirely (including all images inside them, because `force_delete = true`). `terraform apply` recreates the repos but they are empty. `k8s/kustomization.yaml` still references the image tag from the last CI run (e.g. `d0a09a32`), which no longer exists in the new empty repos. Kubernetes nodes cannot pull the image and crash immediately.

**Fix**  
After every `terraform apply` that recreates ECR repos, trigger the CI/CD pipeline to rebuild and push images. The pipeline runs on push to `main`, so make any commit to `main`:

```powershell
# Option 1 – empty commit (no file changes needed)
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: re-trigger CI after ECR recreate"
git push origin main
```

Then in GitHub → Actions → DevSecOps Pipeline → approve the `deploy` stage (environment: production) when prompted. After approval, the pipeline commits a new image tag to `k8s/kustomization.yaml` and ArgoCD deploys within 3 minutes.

**Notes**
- The pipeline takes ~10–15 min (SAST + Trivy scan + build + push)
- The `deploy` stage requires manual approval — watch for the approval prompt in the GitHub Actions UI

## 23. `eks_bootstrap.py` Phase 9 — wrong Route53 DNS records printed (`*.b17facebook.xyz` doesn't match two-level subdomains)

**Symptom**  
Phase 9 told the user to create `*.b17facebook.xyz` as the Route53 wildcard A record. After doing so, `bookstore.b17facebook.xyz` worked (one level deep — matches the wildcard) but `api.bookstore.b17facebook.xyz` did not (two levels deep — wildcards in DNS only match exactly one label).

**Root cause**  
The bootstrap script printed generic records (`{DOMAIN}.` and `*.{DOMAIN}.`) without reading the actual ingress hostnames. A single-level DNS wildcard (`*.b17facebook.xyz`) matches `bookstore.b17facebook.xyz` but not `api.bookstore.b17facebook.xyz`.

**Fix**  
`eks_bootstrap.py` Phase 9 now derives the exact hostnames from the `DOMAIN` constant and prints them explicitly:

```python
frontend_host = f"bookstore.{DOMAIN}"   # bookstore.b17facebook.xyz
backend_host  = f"api.bookstore.{DOMAIN}"  # api.bookstore.b17facebook.xyz
```

**Correct Route53 records to create/update:**

| Record | Type | Value |
|--------|------|-------|
| `bookstore.b17facebook.xyz` | A | ALIAS → NLB hostname from Phase 9 |
| `api.bookstore.b17facebook.xyz` | A | ALIAS → same NLB hostname |

Both records point to the same NLB. Go to Route 53 → Hosted zones → `b17facebook.xyz` → edit each A record → Alias to NLB.

## 24. CI/CD pipeline — `latest` tag push fails on immutable ECR repository

**Error** (GitHub Actions `build-and-push` job)
```
tag invalid: The image tag 'latest' already exists in the 'bookstore-backend' repository
and cannot be overwritten because the tag is immutable.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root cause**  
ECR repos are configured with `image_tag_mutability = "IMMUTABLE"` (correct for security — prevents accidental tag overwrites). The pipeline pushed the SHA tag successfully, then tried to also tag and push `latest`. On the second and every subsequent pipeline run, `latest` already exists in ECR and cannot be overwritten due to immutability. The build fails after images are already pushed.

**Fix**  
`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` — remove the `latest` re-tag and push for both backend and frontend. The `latest` tag is redundant: kustomize always deploys specific SHA tags, so `latest` is never referenced by the cluster.

```yaml
# Before (broken on second run)
- name: Push backend image + tag as latest
  run: |
    docker push $ECR/$BACKEND_REPO:$TAG
    docker tag  $ECR/$BACKEND_REPO:$TAG $ECR/$BACKEND_REPO:latest
    docker push $ECR/$BACKEND_REPO:latest   # ← fails if latest exists

# After (correct)
- name: Push backend image
  run: |
    docker push $ECR/$BACKEND_REPO:$TAG
```

Same change applied to the frontend step.

## 25. Backend `CrashLoopBackOff` — MySQL `ER_HOST_NOT_PRIVILEGED` (backend pod IP rejected)

**Error** (from `kubectl logs -n bookstore <backend-pod>`)
```
Connected to backend on port 3000.
Error: Host '170.20.5.88' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
    code: 'ER_HOST_NOT_PRIVILEGED'
```

**Root cause**  
MySQL's `ER_HOST_NOT_PRIVILEGED` (error 1130) means no row in `mysql.user` matches the connecting host for the user. The MySQL Docker image creates `MYSQL_USER@'%'` during first-run initialization, but if `db-secret` did not exist when `mysql-0` first started (pod was in `CreateContainerConfigError`), and then was created moments later causing a restart, the initialization timing can result in `admin@'localhost'` being created instead of `admin@'%'`, or the user not being created at all.

**Diagnosis** (PowerShell-safe — decodes the password from the k8s secret then calls mysql directly without going through bash -c quoting):
```powershell
$pass = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String((kubectl get secret db-secret -n bookstore -o jsonpath='{.data.DB_PASSWORD}')))
kubectl exec -n bookstore mysql-0 -- mysql -uroot -p"$pass" -e "SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;"
```
Look for `admin` — if host is `localhost` instead of `%` the backend pods on other nodes are blocked.

**Fix** — create `admin@'%'` and grant privileges:
```powershell
kubectl exec -n bookstore mysql-0 -- mysql -uroot -p"$pass" -e "CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '$pass'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
```
After this, delete the backend pods so they restart and reconnect:
```powershell
kubectl delete pods -n bookstore -l app=backend
```

**Note — PowerShell quoting trap**  
`kubectl exec -- bash -c '...'` with single quotes fails in PowerShell because PowerShell strips the outer single quotes and the shell command breaks. Always use the pattern above: decode the secret in PowerShell, then pass values directly as kubectl exec arguments (no bash -c needed).
